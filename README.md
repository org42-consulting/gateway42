## 1. Why This Project Exists (The Real Story)

This project was built to solve a **real in-house operational problem**, not as a demo or abstraction exercise.

As teams increasingly adopted AI/ML, Computer Vision, DevOps automation, and research workflows, the usage pattern evolved rapidly:

- Local LLMs (via Ollama) for offline validation and privacy-sensitive work
- Open WebUI for human interaction and exploration
- Automation tools (n8n, scripts, CI jobs) that **cannot depend on GUIs**
- Occasional use of cloud LLM APIs with privacy and cost constraints

While Ollama is an excellent **local inference engine**, it is intentionally **not designed** for:

- Multi-user access
- Authentication or user isolation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging
- Automation safety
- Governance or accountability

At one point, a single automation pipeline overwhelmed the local inference host.
There was **no visibility** into:
- Who sent the requests
- Which pipeline caused the issue
- How frequently the system was being used
- Whether misuse or misconfiguration occurred

The system recovered-but the problem was clear.

This gateway was built as a **lightweight, production-safe control layer** to:

- Protect the core inference engine
- Isolate users and automation pipelines
- Enable safe API-based access
- Provide auditability and traceability
- Preserve privacy and offline operation
- Avoid touching or destabilizing the inference stack itself

---

## 2. Design Philosophy

This project follows a **governance-first, minimal-footprint philosophy**:

- Ollama remains **localhost-only**
- Users never interact with the inference engine directly
- All access is authenticated and logged
- Rate limits protect system stability
- UI exists only for governance, not inference
- Automation is a first-class use case
- The gateway is intentionally lightweight
- No system Python pollution
- Clean isolation under `/opt`

## 4. Core Security Boundary (Critical)

**The gateway must be installed on the same machine where Ollama is running.**

* Ollama listens only on:

  ```
  http://127.0.0.1:11434
  ```
* Ollama is never exposed over LAN
* All external access is mediated by the gateway
* Users cannot bypass authentication or rate limits

This boundary is **intentional and enforced by design**.

---

Admin can:

* Approve or disable users
* Reset user passwords to `admin123`
* Export per-user audit logs (CSV)
* Permanently delete users (export enforced)
* Change admin password

---

## 8. Access & User Management

### Base URL

```
http://<HOST_IP>:7000
```

Example:

```
http://192.168.1.2:7000
```

### Default Admin Account

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin123`
* **Mandatory password change after first login**

---

## 9. Rate Limiting

* Default: **10 requests per minute per user**
* Enforced at the gateway
* Applies to scripts, automation, and pipelines
* Prevents runaway workloads

HTTP `429` is returned if exceeded.

## 15. Project Versioning & Evolution

This project has evolved in **intentional phases**, each solving a specific problem.

| Version  | Focus                                  | Status    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **v1.0** | Headless API gateway (PoC)             | Completed |
| **v2.x** | Auth, UI, audit, rate limiting         | Current   |
| **v3.x** | Hybrid local + cloud LLM control plane | Planned   |

### v1.0 – Headless Gateway

---

## 16. Cloud & Hybrid Capability (Planned)

The gateway is architecturally designed to support **cloud LLM APIs** without exposing raw credentials.

Planned capabilities:

* Provider routing per request
* Centralized API key storage
* Unified auth, logging, rate limits
* Safe internal sharing of paid accounts
* Hybrid local + cloud workloads

---

## 17. Roadmap

Planned enhancements:

1. Admin-editable per-user rate limits
2. Authenticated model discovery API
3. Hybrid provider routing (local + cloud)
4. Usage metrics & observability dashboard

---

## 18. Capacity, Limits & Operational Expectations (Important)

This project is intentionally designed as a **lightweight governance and control layer** for local and hybrid LLM usage.
It is **not** a high-throughput inference platform or a public multi-tenant service.

The following limits and expectations are provided to ensure **correct usage, stability, and realistic planning**.

---

### 18.1 Intended Usage Profile

This gateway is best suited for:

* Small to mid-sized teams (research, AI/ML, CV, DevOps)
* Shared on-prem GPU environments
* Automation pipelines requiring **auditability and safety**
* Privacy-first or offline-first deployments

It is **not intended** for:

* High-bandwidth public APIs
* Large-scale SaaS inference
* Unbounded concurrency workloads
* Multi-region or HA inference clusters

---

### 18.2 Tested & Practical Capacity (Realistic Numbers)

These numbers reflect **safe operating ranges**, not theoretical maximums.

#### User Scale

| Metric                  | Supported Range |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Active users            | 5 – 20          |
| Concurrent active users | 2 – 5           |
| Admin users             | 1 – 2           |

Inference capacity, not the gateway, becomes the bottleneck beyond this.

---

#### Request Rate

| Metric                    | Value                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Default rate limit        | **10 requests / minute / user** |
| Aggregate safe throughput | ~50–200 requests / minute       |
| Enforcement point         | Gateway                         |

If exceeded, HTTP `429` is returned to protect system stability.

---

### 18.3 Concurrency Model

| Layer        | Constraint                       |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Gateway      | Async, handles many HTTP clients |
| SQLite (WAL) | Single writer, many readers      |
| Ollama       | GPU-bound, model dependent       |

Requests may queue naturally; rate limiting prevents cascading failures.

---

### 18.4 Token Length & Prompt Size

* Token limits are enforced by the model (not the gateway)
* Recommended usage:

| Prompt Type        | Suggested Limit |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Automation prompts | <1k tokens      |
| Analysis tasks     | 2k–4k tokens    |
| Large context      | Use sparingly   |

Excessive prompts can monopolize GPU time.

---

### 18.5 Multimodal (Images, Attachments)

If using models like LLaVA:

| Factor             | Practical Limit |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Images per request | 1               |
| Image size         | <5 MB           |
| Concurrent users   | 1–2             |

Multimodal inference is significantly more resource-intensive.

---

### 18.6 Logging & Storage

Each request logs:

* User identity
* Prompt
* Model response
* Timestamp

| Component    | Notes                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| SQLite (WAL) | Safe for concurrent access |
| Growth       | Linear with usage          |
| CSV export   | Mandatory before deletion  |

Avoid network-mounted filesystems for the DB.

---

### 18.7 Known Constraints (By Design)

This gateway does **not attempt** to handle:

| Scenario                     | Outcome               |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Hundreds of concurrent users | Inference starvation  |
| Public traffic               | Rate-limited / denied |
| Large file uploads           | GPU contention        |
| Unbounded token use          | Latency spikes        |

These are deliberate design boundaries.

---

### 18.8 Positioning vs Large-Scale Platforms

| Aspect      | This Gateway   | SaaS Platforms |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Privacy     | Full (on-prem) | Partial        |
| Audit depth | Full           | Limited        |
| Cost        | Hardware-only  | Usage-based    |
| Scale       | Limited        | Very high      |
| Control     | Full           | Partial        |

This system optimizes for **control and accountability**, not raw throughput.

---

## 19. Development & Hot Reloading

For development purposes, the gateway supports hot reloading to speed up the development workflow. When running with the `--reload` flag, the application will automatically restart when Python source files change.

To run with hot reloading:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh --reload
```

Or directly:
```bash
python -m app.app --reload
```

This feature is particularly useful during development as you don't need to manually restart the server after making code changes.

## 20. Final Notes

This is not a cloud LLM platform.
It is not a UI replacement.

It is a **focused, lightweight LLM control plane** designed to safely expose inference capabilities to humans and automation.

Built because it was needed.
Shared because others face the same problem.
